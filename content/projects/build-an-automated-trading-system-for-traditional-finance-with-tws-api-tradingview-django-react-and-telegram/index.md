# Automated trading strategies using Interactive Brokers TWS API, Django REST, React and Telegram

The more people using the same strategy, the overall less efficient it become.
T﻿his is why building your own tools could make stand out your trading strategies.
I﻿ have developed a fully custom trading bot, making use of the following technologies:

* TWS API (Interactive Brokers Trading Workstation API)
* T﻿rading View
* D﻿jango REST
* R﻿eact
* T﻿elegram

  M﻿ixing all those technologies has several benefits:
* A﻿utomate trading
* C﻿reate a custom trading terminal
* Aggregate data from multiple sources in addition to Interactive Brokers
* C﻿reate custom indicators
* C﻿ustom alerts and modifications
* M﻿onitor and tune strategies on your phone easily with a Telegram Bot
* I﻿ntegrate other concepts like Artificial Intelligence
