# Automated trading strategies using Interactive Brokers TWS API, Django REST, React and Telegram

The more people using the same strategy, the overall less efficient it become.
T﻿his is why building your own tools could make stand out your trading strategies.
I﻿ have developed a fully custom trading bot, making use of the following technologies:

* TWS API (Interactive Brokers Trading Workstation API)
* T﻿rading View
* D﻿jango REST
* R﻿eact
* T﻿elegram
